# Bird-Data-Acquisition-Tool
This repo contains the script used to acquire the bird sounds dataset for the BAD-Classifier project. Only South African bird data is downloaded from [xeno-canto](https://www.xeno-canto.org/). The country can be changed by editing the string that contains the API endpoint call. The file and current progress will be shown in the console output.

Example output 
```
python3 XenoCantoHabere.py
```
